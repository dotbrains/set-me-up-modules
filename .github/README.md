# 'set-me-up' Universal Modules

This repository is designed to be used as a submodule to the [`set-me-up` blueprint](https://github.com/dotbrains/set-me-up-blueprint) repository.

## _Why abstract these modules to an external repository?_

When installing the [_blueprint_ configuration](https://github.com/dotbrains/set-me-up-installer/blob/main/install.sh#L229), we need to be able to obtain our custom modules defined in your blueprint as well as the set of universal modules that _set-me-up_ provides.
